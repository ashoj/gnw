======

These evaluation scripts are identical to the ones available on the DREAM website (http://wiki.c2b2.columbia.edu/dream), they are provided here as a bundle for convenience. These scripts were developed by Robert Prill and Gustavo Stolovitzky (see file headers for details).

You may use these scripts to evaluate your predictions for the DREAM in silico challenges or for networks that you generated yourself using GNW.


*DREAM4 challenge*

Evaluation scripts of the DREAM4 in silico challenge, may also be used to evaluate predictions for other networks generated using GNW.


*DREAM3 challenge*

Evaluation scripts of the DREAM3 challenge.


*Deprecated*

The file evaluation.m in this directory is a modified version of the DREAM3 challenge evaluation script. It can be used with gold standard files where zero (absent) connections are not explicitly listed. In the DREAM3 and DREAM4 gold standard files zero connections are listed and this evaluation script is *not* needed. One advantage of this script is that it also draws the PR and ROC curves.
