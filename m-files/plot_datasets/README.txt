These Matlab scripts can be used to load and plot steady-state and time-series gene expression datasets from GNW.

We provide these scripts "as is", you may have to customize or improve them for your purpose. If you have written a more sophisticated script suitable to visualize GNW datasets and would like to share it with other users, let us know!
