GeneNetWeaver
=============

Numerous methods have been developed for reverse engineering gene regulatory networks from expression data. Unraveling and modeling these networks is of primary importance for improving our understanding of biological organisms. However, both their absolute and comparative performance remain poorly understood. **The aim of this project is to provide benchmarks and tools for rigorous testing of methods for gene network inference**.

We have developed novel approaches for the generation of biologically plausible *in silico* benchmarks and for the identification of systematic errors of network inference algorithms. Our framework is available as an easy-to-use Java tool called GeneNetWeaver (GNW). GNW is the first computational tool to provide methods for both benchmark generation and performance profiling of network inference methods.

GNW participates to an international effort to assess biological network inference by providing tools that helped experimenters to evaluate the accuracy of thousands of gene network predictions. Moreover, we have used GNW to organize the [international DREAM3, DREAM4 and DREAM5 competitions](http://tschaffter.ch/projects/gnw/#DREAM).
